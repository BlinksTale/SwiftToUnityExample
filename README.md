# Swift To Unity SharePlay iOS Example
This example project demonstrates how to setup your SharePlay Xcode project so that your Swift code is able to call Unity's Objective-C methods for GroupActivities (e.g. `UnitySendMessage`), particularly in Unity 2019.3 and later. Original SwiftToUnity by jwtan, SharePlay update by Brian Handy.

## Unity 2019.2 and earlier
If you're running Unity 2019.2 and earlier, the solution is simple. You just need a [Bridging Header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_objective-c_into_swift) that imports `UnityInterface.h`. This will allow your Swift code to call `UnitySendMessage` without any further modifications.

## Unity 2019.3 and later
If you're running Unity 2019.3 and later, things get more complicated. The structure of the generated [Xcode project](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StructureOfXcodeProject.html) has been changed so as to accommodate the Unity as a Library feature. The most important change is that all Unity functionality has been moved into a framework target called UnityFramework.

### Bridging Header
Let's try our original approach -- the Bridging Header. Since all Unity functionality is contained in the UnityFramework target, we'll reference the Bridging Header in the Build Settings for this target.

Running a build at this point reveals a problem:
```
<unknown>:0: error: using bridging headers with framework targets is unsupported
```
It looks like we'll have to try something else.

### Umbrella Header
Fortunately, the [Bridging Header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_objective-c_into_swift) document also includes a section about importing code within a framework target.

1. Set the `DEFINES_MODULE` build setting for UnityFramework to `Yes`.
2. In the Umbrella Header of UnityFramework (i.e. `UnityFramework/UnityFramework.h`), import the Objective-C header that we want to expose to Swift (i.e. `#import "UnityInterface.h"`).

Running a build at this point reveals a new problem:
```
Include of non-modular header inside framework module 'UnityFramework':'.../UnityInterface.h'
```

Researching this error message, it appears that `UnityInterface.h` needs to be made publicly available as part of the framework's public headers. These are the steps:

1. In the Project Navigator view, select `Classes/Unity/UnityInterface.h`
2. Go to the Inspectors panel (right side of the screen) and select the File Inspector tab
3. In the Target Membership section, enable the checkbox for UnityFramework and set its scope to `Public`.

We'll also need to set these settings recursively for the header files that `UnityInterface.h` itself references. Here is the full list of header files that we need to modify:
* `Classes/Unity/UnityInterface.h`
* `Classes/Unity/UnityForwardDecls.h`
* `Classes/Unity/UnityRendering.h`
* `Classes/Unity/UnitySharedDecls.h`

Running another build and... it builds successfully! At this point, we already have a working integration. However, there is another possible solution...

### Module Map
While researching this problem, I came across some suggestions about using a Module Map.

Swift [documentation](https://swift.org/swift-compiler/#compiler-architecture) states that the Swift compiler has the ability to import [Clang Modules](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html) and map the Objective-C APIs they export into their corresponding Swift APIs. Fortunately, Xcode already treats framework targets as Modules so we just need to define a [Module Map](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#module-maps) for UnityFramework that defines a [Submodule](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#submodule-declaration) for `UnityInterface.h`.

The default Module Map for UnityFramework looks like this:
```
framework module UnityFramework {
  umbrella header "UnityFramework.h"

  export *
  module * { export * }
}
```
We'll then define a Submodule in it like this :
```
framework module UnityFramework {
  umbrella header "UnityFramework.h"

  export *
  module * { export * }

  module UnityInterface {
      header "UnityInterface.h"

      export *
  }
}
```

Proceed to complete the setup by doing the following:
- Save the modified Module Map in a file with the extension `.modulemap`.
- Add this file to your Xcode project.
- Reference this file in the `MODULEMAP_FILE` build setting for UnityFramework.
- Set Target Membership settings recursively for `UnityInterface.h` and the header files it references.

Overall, this method seems to be a better approach as it's cleaner and you avoid having to do something intrusive like manually editing the Umbrella Header (i.e. `UnityFramework.h`).

## Key Files

### UnityFramework.modulemap
Module Map file that defines a Submodule for `UnityInterface.h`.

### SwiftToUnityPostProcess.cs
Build post process script that automatically implements the integration steps:

- Set the `DEFINES_MODULE` build setting for UnityFrameworks to `Yes`.
- Copy and add the `UnityFramework.modulemap` file to the Xcode project.
- Reference `UnityFramework.modulemap` in the `MODULEMAP_FILE` build setting for UnityFrameworks.
- Add the following headers to the UnityFramework target and set their scope to `Public`:
-- `Classes/Unity/UnityInterface.h`
-- `Classes/Unity/UnityForwardDecls.h`
-- `Classes/Unity/UnityRendering.h`
-- `Classes/Unity/UnitySharedDecls.h`

## Example Files

### CubeScript.cs
Example monobehaviour script that calls `SwiftToUnityBridge.mm` during `Start()` and receives messages sent from `SwiftToUnity.swift`.

### SwiftToUnityBridge.mm
Example Objective-C script that is called by `CubeScript.cs` during `Start()` which triggers `SwiftToUnity.swift` to call `UnitySendMessage`.

### SwiftToUnity.swift
Example Swift script that calls `UnitySendMessage`.

## SharePlay Notes
Code should "just work" on iOS devices. Update to iOS 15.0 is required for all SharePlay, so that applies here too. We don't have error messages in yet for iOS 14.0 and below, but they don't crash either. Entitlements file is hooked in and copied over so that GroupSession (GroupActivity) Capability is requested automatically on build time (ie. Unity Cloud Build friendly). SharePlay code is a bit messy, but has all basics working.
